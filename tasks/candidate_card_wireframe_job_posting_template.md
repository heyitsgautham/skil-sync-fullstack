- Click/chips open detail panel with evidence snippets and project references
- Missing skills shown with `impact` and `recommended action`

## Experience timeline
- Compact timeline: role name, company, from→to, tags (skills used)
- Show computed `relevant_years`

## Education & Certs
- Degree, institution, match_level, cert badges

## Projects

## AI Recommendation block
- `action`, `priority`, `strengths`, `concerns`, `interview_focus` (3 suggested questions)
- Show LLM prompt & response provenance (collapsed by default)

## Bias & Audit
- If blind mode or checks ran: small chip `Fair Screening Active` and `Audit ID`
- Fairness quick metric (if computed): e.g., `Fairness Score: 0.92`

# 6. Tailored vs Base Resume — UX & Policy suggestions

## UX flows
1. **Base resume (default):** when a user signs up and uploads their base resume, the system extracts structured data and the candidate becomes discoverable across all job postings (precomputed matches appear to HR).
2. **Tailored resume (optional per application):** Candidate can upload a tailored resume when applying. On application, compute a real-time tailored score and combine with base precomputed score (configurable mix, e.g., 70% tailored + 30% base).

## UI affordances
- Show `Active resume: Base` or `Active resume: Tailored for Job X` on candidate profile
- When HR views candidate list, indicate whether score is derived from base or tailored resume (icon + tooltip)
- Allow candidates to submit tailored resume before applying (encourage it)

## Policy notes
- Make clear in UI that base resume allows discoverability; tailored resume improves chance for specific job but does not remove base discoverability unless candidate explicitly deactivates base resume.
- Logging: whenever tailored resume is uploaded, record timestamp and which job it targets.

# 7. Suggestions & Best Practices (short)
- **Force structured fields on job posting** (min years + must vs preferred skills) — biggest ROI for explainability.
- **Always show provenance snippets** for every claim in the candidate card — HR trusts a highlighted line more than a percentage.
- **Expose adjustable weight sliders** for hiring managers to re-balance matching for specific roles — record choice in audit log.
- **Keep confidence visible** — when confidence is low, recommend human verification steps.
- **Provide easy export (PDF) of explanation** for compliance and audit during demo.
